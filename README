This reposiitory is intended to be layered over the standard grimoire, for use in those case where 
you wish to install anything which depends on Qt5, including KDE Frameworks, Plasm Next and various 
applications.

Use 'scribe add' in order to add it to your stack of grimoires, or edit 
'/etc/sorcery/local/grimoire'.

My stack looks like this:

GRIMOIRE_DIR[0]=/var/git/smgl-qt5
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[1]=/var/git/smgl-qt4
GRIMOIRE_DIR[2]=/var/git/localrepos
GRIMOIRE_DIR[3]=/var/git/smgl
GRIMOIRE_DIR[4]=/home/treeve/mygrim
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[5]=/var/git/smgl-b
#GRIMOIRE_DIR[6]=/var/git/smgl-z


All spells in this grimoire will be installed to '/usr'.

The reason for doing this is that, although Qt5 and KF5 could be co-installedwith the Qt4/KDE4 
eqivalents, many of the other spell cannot be

Since it is not known when QT5 based versions of various applications will be released,  we need
a gradual transition from Qt4 to Qt5.

It is possible to to run existing Qt4 based applications the new Plasma Workspace, until a Qt5 
based version becomes available.

The recommended way of starting a Plasma session is to use the SDDM (Simple Display Manager), 
since, unlike KDE-Workspace, Plasma Desktop does not provide a Login Manager. SDDM can also start 
KDE4 sessions.

KDE-Workspace does not need to be installed when using KDE4 applications on a Plasma Workspace.


Users of the Plasma Desktop must be added to the 'plasma' group.
